## Hi! Australian National Corpus has moved

The Australian National Corpus (AusNC) was a discovery service that collated and provided access to examples of Australian English text, transcriptions, audio and audio-visual materials. The service was managed by Griffith University beginning 2012 until mid-2023 when the site was decommissioned. From 2023, AusNC data are being made available as individual collections (listed below) through the [Language Data Commons of Australia (LDaCA) data portal](https://data.ldaca.edu.au).
